## Univariate and Bivariate Stats and Graphics

This workshop will be held on Monday July 23, 2018.

The focus of this workshop is on visualizing variables and computing summary statistics for those variables in your dataset one (univariate) or two (bivariate) at a time. This workshop will introduce both base R graphical approaches and `ggplot2` graphics.
